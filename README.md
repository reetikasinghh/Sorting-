# Sorting-
Program Aim:
The aim of this program is to provide a user-friendly interface for sorting an array of integers using three different sorting algorithms: Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, and Bubble Sort.

Theory:

Selection Sort:

Selection Sort works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and moving it to the beginning of the sorted part.

It maintains two subarrays: the sorted subarray and the unsorted subarray.

The sorted subarray starts as an empty subarray, and the program iterates through the unsorted subarray, selecting the minimum element each time and swapping it with the first element of the unsorted subarray.

This process continues until the entire array is sorted.

.Insertion Sort:

Insertion Sort builds the final sorted array one element at a time.

It starts with the first element as the sorted part and takes the next element from the unsorted part.

The program compares the selected element with the elements in the sorted part and inserts it into the correct position in the sorted array.

This process continues until all elements are in the sorted order.

Bubble Sort:

Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted.
In each pass, the largest element "bubbles up" to its correct position at the end of the list.
Algorithm:

Prompt the user to enter the number of elements in the array.

Allow the user to input the elements of the array.

Present a menu to the user for selecting a sorting algorithm.

Based on the user's choice, apply the selected sorting algorithm to sort the array.
Display the sorted array to the user.
Conclusion:
This program provides a practical example of how three fundamental sorting algorithms work and allows users to apply them to sort an array of integers. It offers a simple and interactive way to understand and visualize the sorting process, making it a useful educational tool for learning about sorting algorithms. By selecting the appropriate sorting algorithm, users can efficiently sort their data as needed.
